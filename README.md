## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Astro](https://astro.build/) - JS web framework

### What I learned

I learned how to use the @font-face CSS rule to define custom fonts on a website.

Example of code used in my challenge below:

```css
@font-face {
    font-family: "Outfit Bold";
    src: url("../assets/outfit/static/Outfit-Bold.ttf");
    font-weight: bold;
    font-style: normal;
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to continue learning to write semantic and accessible HTML.
Continue to delve deeper into the concepts of Astro, this wonderful javascript web framework

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - Here I learned how to use the @font-face CSS rule. I really enjoyed studying on MDN, and I will continue to use it in the future.
- [Astro](https://astro.build/) - This is an amazing site where you can learn how to use this technology.
